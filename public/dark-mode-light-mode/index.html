    Dark mode, light mode, balcony
</h2>
<p><p>Everybody says dark mode is good.
Or <a href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/11/19/Dark-Mode-Should-Be-The-Default-With-95-Percent-Preferring-it-Over-Light-Mode.html">around 95% of people</a>.
But they say it's not based on clean data because the default setting was dark.</p>
<p>Everybody says light mode is good.
Or at least some <a href="https://kevq.uk/is-dark-mode-such-a-good-idea/">punk bloggers and scientists</a>.
But they say we should not trust scientists anymore (rightfully so?).</p>
<p>I don't know if dark mode is good or bad (it's <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode/">probably both</a>).
What I know for sure, since 2020 summer working-from-home situation, is that light mode is way better out on the balcony.
I challenge you to read something in dark mode when enjoying the bright sunlight, sipping some cold beverage out on the balcony (if you're lucky to have one near).</p>
